            <p>A balanced diet includes foods from five groups and fulfills all of a person’s nutritional 
                needs. Eating a balanced diet helps people maintain good health and reduce their risk of 
                disease. Dietary guidelines evolve with scientific advances, so it can be challenging to 
                stay on top of current recommendations and know what to eat. In this article, we look 
                at current dietary recommendations and describe how to build a balanced diet.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>What is a balanced diet?</h3>
            <p>A balanced diet is one that fulfills all of a person’s nutritional needs. Humans need a 
                certain amount of calories and nutrients to stay healthy. A balanced diet provides all 
                the nutrients a person requires, without going over the recommended daily calorie intake.                
                By eating a balanced diet, people can get the nutrients and calories they need and avoid 
                eating junk food, or food without nutritional value. The United States Department of 
                Agriculture (USDA) used to recommend following a food pyramid. However, as nutritional 
                science has changed, they now recommend eating foods from the five groups and building a 
                balanced plate. According to the USDA’s recommendations, half of a person’s plate should 
                consist of fruits and vegetables. The other half should be made up of grains and protein. 
                They recommend accompanying each meal with a serving of low-fat dairy or another source of 
                the nutrients found in dairy.</p>
                <br>
            <h3>The five food groups</h3>
                <p>A healthful balanced diet includes foods from these 5 groups:</p>
                <br>
                <p>1. Vegetables</p>
                <br>
                <p>2. Fruits</p>
                <br>
                <p>3. Grains</p>
                <br>
                <p>4. Protein</p>
                <br>
                <p>5. Dairy</p>
                <br>
            <h3>Vegetables</h3>
                <p>The vegetable group includes 5 subgroups:</p>
                <br>
                <p>1. Leafy greans</p>
                <br>
                <p>2. Red or orange vegetables</p>
                <br>
                <p>3. Starchy vegetables</p>
                <br>
                <p>4. Beans and peas</p>
                <br>
                <p>5. Other vegetables such as eggplant or zucchini</p>
                <br>
                <p>To get enough nutrients and keep dietary boredom at bay, people should choose a 
                    variety of vegetables. Additionally, the USDA recommend that people eat vegetables 
                    from each of the five subgroups every week. People may enjoy vegetables raw or cooked. 
                    However, it is important to remember that cooking vegetables removes some of their 
                    nutritional value. Also, some methods, such as deep-frying, can add unhealthful fats 
                    to a dish.</p>
                    <br>
            <h3>Fruits</h3>
                <p>A balanced diet also includes plenty of fruit. Instead of getting fruit from juice, 
                    nutrition experts recommend eating whole fruits. Juice contains fewer nutrients. 
                    Also, the manufacturing process often adds empty calories due to added sugar. People 
                    should opt for fresh or frozen fruits, or fruits canned in water instead of syrup.</p>
                    <br>
            <h3>Grains</h3>
                <p>There are two subgroups: whole grains and refined grains. Whole grains include all 
                    three parts of the grain, which are the bran, germ, and endosperm. The body breaks 
                    down whole grains slowly, so they have less effect on a person’s blood sugar.Additionally, 
                    whole grains tend to contain more fiber and protein than refined grains. Refined 
                    grains are processed and do not contain the three original components. Refined 
                    grains also tend to have less protein and fiber, and they can cause blood sugar 
                    spikes. Grains used to form the base of the government-approved food pyramid, 
                    meaning that most of a person’s daily caloric intake came from grains. However, the 
                    updated guidelines suggest that grains should make up only a quarter of a person’s 
                    plate.</p>
                    <br>
            <h3>Protein</h3>
                <p>The 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans state that all people should include 
                    nutrient-dense protein as part of their regular diet. The guidelines suggest that 
                    this protein should make up a quarter of a person’s plate. Nutritious protein 
                    choices include:</p>
                    <br>
                <p>1. Lean beef and pork</p>
                <br>
                <p>2. Chicken and turkey</p>
                <br>
                <p>3. Fish</p>
                <br>
                <p>4. Beans, peas, and legumes</p>
                <br>
            <h3>Dairy</h3>
                <p>Dairy and fortified soy products are a vital source of calcium. The USDA recommend 
                    consuming low-fat versions whenever possible. Low-fat dairy and soy products include:</p>
                <br>
                <p>1. Ricotta or cottage cheese</p>
                <br>
                <p>2. Low fat milk</p>
                <br>
                <p>3. Yogurt</p>
                <br>
                <p>4. Soy milk</p>
                <br>
                <p>People who are lactose intolerant can opt for low-lactose or lactose-free products, 
                    or choose soy-based sources of calcium and other nutrients.</p> 
                <br>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>Eating a balanced diet means eating foods from the five major groups. Dietary guidelines 
                    change over time, as scientists discover new information about nutrition. Current 
                    recommendations suggest that a person’s plate should contain primarily vegetables and fruits, 
                    some lean protein, some dairy, and soluble fiber. People interested in weight loss 
                    should also consider introducing moderate exercise into their routines.
